# Masters_Research
## This repository houses the work that I'm doing for my Masters project.
## Currently there is a lot of work being done, but the study region is the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.
## I will be using hyperspectral satellite to analyze the environment in either wildfire change or change due to other things.
